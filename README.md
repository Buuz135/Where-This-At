Where This At will allow you search all inventories near the "Inventory Lectern" and it will list all the items. You can craft this in the Crafting Bench - Tinkering

In this GUI you will be able to highlight where the item is or pull that item to your inventory.

You will be to deposit items too from your inventory to those chests. You can configure to only deposit if the chest already has that item and you can configure to leave 1 item in the slot when extracting.
